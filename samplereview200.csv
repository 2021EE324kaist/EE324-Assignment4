0,0,0,Manly Candy,"I received a pound of Buffalo Bill's hickory pieces as a gift, and enjoyed the size of the pieces and the consistency of the beef's tenderness and flavor. The box happened to come with a couple of samples courtesy of Choo Choo snacks, one of which were a few pieces of the maple pepper beef jerky. After finishing the hickory I went ahead and opened up the maple, and ate it all in maybe 30 seconds. This jerky is so unique and borderline mouthwatering, I actually broke down and bought a pound of it. It's just ever so slightly spicy, and the smell and taste of the maple syrup hits you at the start then lingers after you've finished it. I don't profess to be some sort of food critic, but I figured something this tasty deserved a review with a few big words. So if you like eating healthy and are looking for a nice treat, I really recommend this!",2011-04-03 19:00,22,2,0,5

The Buffalo Bills Premium Maple Pepper Beef Jerky gives me that great maple syrup taste with a twist.  The classic smokey Buffalo Bills Premium jerky paired with the delicious warm sweetness of maple sugar and the robust taste of cracked black pepper all come together to create a wonderful treat. There is a good balance between the maple sugar and black pepper; both are strong flavors but neither overpowers the taste of this jerky. The size of the Maple Pepper Beef Jerky pieces make it easy to enjoy this treat any time. I'm glad the people at Choo Choo R Snacks are quick with the shipping; they make it so easy to enjoy my favorite jerky.",2010-12-07 19:00,26,0,0,5

12,1,12,The Rub You Crave,"I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu. Since trying these rubs, however, especially the Finger Lickin', I just can't bring myself to try them any place else.  The rub is perfectly spicy, perfectly smoky and leaves you craving more. We grill up these bad boys at least once a week in our household, but I have also marinated whole chickens, spiced up some grilled shrimp and even added to popcorn. AMAZING. The levels of heat are, shall we say, pretty extreme. The Easy Pickin' is for those of you that like a teeny-tiny amount of heat in your dishes (think poblano), Finger Lickin' for those a little more adventuresome (think jalapeno) and for those of you that ski the Black Diamonds, well, you really should try What Was I Thinkin' (think Ghost Pepper, times 4). The first bite I took made me kinda giggle like, hey, I got this. I defeat you Ghost Pepper. Then....it....hit. I have never sweated, cried and guffawed all at the same time. It was, truly, an unreal experience and I'm ever so grateful I tried it.<br /><br />I sure hope you give these a shot. You will truly be impressed with the flavor sensations!!!",2012-09-19 19:00,34,0,0,5

After less than a minute of whisking, the matcha created a nice blanket of foam. The first sip was heavenly and after adding some agave, the cheesecake flavor popped even more. This has become one of my favorite matchas and I'm excited to mix it with other flavors and make signature flavored cheesecakes.",2012-10-23 19:00,38,0,0,5
17,2,17,Cheese-less Cheesecake!,"I've heard great, great things about this matcha and I couldn't wait to try it. But real life stepped in and I didn't have the time to give it the attention it deserved, so, well, I had to wait to try. But I wait no more! Today I got to mix up my first frothy cup of cheesecake matcha goodness. I was stuck at the location I hate at work, so I desperately needed a thermos of matcha comfort and boy oh boy was I not let down! This is amazing stuff. Creamy and just that touch of tang found in a good cheesecake....yum. One of my specialities around this time of year is a pumpkin cheesecake....nom. I can't wait to mix this with a touch of Pumpkin Pie matcha and see how they go together.<br /><br />Oh cheesecake, I have missed you desperately. Cream cheese is one of those things I absolutely cannot have or I'll be ill for days, so cheesecake is, unfortunately permanently off my menu. But with a little beauty like this in my tea cupboard, I find I don't mind nearly as much!

18,2,18,Can't go wrong with cheesecake.,"Cheesecake matcha basically sounds like a dream come true. I'm not sure why I didn't order this with my first order. If I can get matcha that will satisfy my cheesecake craving without all the calories, I am definitely going to try it!<br /><br />I received this with my order of tiramisu and caramel, and although it had the least distinctive smell and flavour, it definitely still had an authentic cheesecakey-ness that was so worth it. I think the best part of this was that it wasn't just matcha that tasted like cheesecake - it tastes like what I imagine matcha-flavoured cheesecake would taste like (I haven't ventured into the world of baking with matcha because I am the only one who would eat it and I really don't need to eat an entire batch of cookies, cheesecake, etc. By myself!).<br /><br />Sweet, but not too sweet, with that little hint of tanginess that you get from cream cheese, this is a perfect after-dinner tea. I am going to make it again and do a better job - I had it iced the first time, and I think that is how I will prefer it, but it wasn't quite cold enough. I took it to work in my timolino and forgot to put ice cubes in!  That will be a necessity next time. I can't wait to mix this with a few other flavours!",2012-09-29 19:00,40,0,0,5

I wasn't quite sure about ordering this one as I wasn't sure if I would like the cheesecake flavour... well I'm glad I did add this one to my cart as it was worth every cent. I make this one half matcha half milk and I've been adding marshmallows it makes it a bit more fun (and fancy!) The cost is reasonable the company's customer service is fantastic.

I have tried three flavoured matchas from Red Leaf, and they are quickly becoming my favourite beverages.<br /><br />This particular matcha has a full, creamy flavour and texture. You can almost even taste the cream cheese tang. There's also a bit of cookie-crust going on here, which I love!<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was delighted with the aroma. It smells sweet and decadent, almost reminded me of matcha ice cream! Must be the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake flavour combined with that familiar, distinctive matcha scent I know and love.<br /><br />This one has become a staple for me, and although there are lots of different flavours I'd love to try, I know I'll always make sure to have some of this on hand. It is so delicious and versatile.",2012-09-16 19:00,42,0,0,5
21,2,21,Perfection in a cup!,"It has been far too long since I've had some matcha so I decided that tonight would be as good as any to remedy that situation. This cheesecake matcha is seriously smooth and has a very strong aroma that makes me want to double check and make sure there isn't any actual cheesecake somewhere in my kitchen. I've had this matcha several times now and each time this flavor is spot on to a real, creamy cheesecake. You can find out more about this matcha here (and pick up some for yourself!):[...]<br /> Initially, I tried this matcha traditionally in my chawan and it was creamy and rich. I was pleasantly surprised that the color was a vibrant green instead of being muddled by the flavoring. Even though the cheesecake flavor is front and center, it is tempered nicely with a smooth, fresh matcha aftertaste that prevents the flavor from being cloying. The matcha also whisked up quite well with no noticeable clumps and I didn't even sift it!<br /><br /> After the initial success with this matcha, I couldn't wait to try it as a hot cheesecake latte. Although the thought of hot liquid cheesecake is not necessarily my idea of a great treat, I was confident that the quality of Red Leaf Tea's product would not let me down. With a bit of sugar and the addition of warm milk, this latte was so great! I downed it in no time flat and had to make another immediately.<br /><br /> Tonight, I'm having this as a cold iced matcha with a teensy bit of sugar and enough milk to complete the cup. The flavor seems to really pop when prepared this way and I'm certainly wondering how I made it for so many days without drinking this or any other of the great flavors from Red Leaf Tea. A couple of weeks ago I made a delicious matcha cake and I think it would be amazing with this cheesecake flavor as the base! Now to figure out what the next flavor I'll try will be...",2012-09-14 19:00,43,0,0,5
22,2,22,Creamy and Delicious!,"There is nothing bad that I can say about this Matcha from Redleaf.  They have hit the flavour right on the money.

It's like biting into the best cheesecake slice you can imagine without the guilt of calories and sugar!",2012-09-14 19:00,44,0,0,5
23,2,23,Dreams really do come true!,"Okay, I was wracking my brain to think of which matcha I had left to review. I actually had to go into my cupboard and sort my Recently Added to figure it out... it was CHEESECAKE! How could I forget?! I've been drinking this glorious Matcha almost every day, not even kidding. I know it'll be the first I run out of and the first I run back to order more of! I might get a tin just for this one, because I know it will be in my cupboard forever. Dear Red Leaf Tea, never stop making matcha!!!! Love, your adoring fans!<br /><br />I have had 2 amazing cheesecakes in my life. One was purchased on a trip to Vancouver from the market on Granville Island. It was tiny. It was expensive. It was amazing! The second was this week from a place called Broadway Cheesecake (something like that) here in Halifax. They have so freaking many kinds of cheesecake, it is crazy! 8 bucks a piece, but the pieces are HUGE. Why am I telling you this? Because this matcha trumps them. It puts the power of cheesecake into my little hands, adds green tea powder to make it amazing, and tastes like heaven on earth!<br /><br />That may seem a little dramatic, but it's the only way I know how to truly show how much I appreciate this matcha in my cupboard. The taste is tangy, thick and a bit sweet. If you add sugar it has the decadence of a perfect cream cheese icing. If you add milk (I tried 2%, almond and vanilla soy) it's a slice from a fine bakery (or cheesecake from home, arguably the best kind!). If you drink it hot - it's fresh from the oven! Iced? It's a perfectly chilled and dense New York piece from the fridge. I could go on, but I guess what I'm trying to say is: Any way you slice it, this Cheesecake Matcha is the best of the best - it has the power to turn my crappy tired morning into an awesome day. Just sayin'.<br /><br />One of the best features of this flavour (and many of the other dessert matchas) is that you get the delicious taste of a rich cheesecake without the tummy-ache and super full and heavy feeling. I won't say without the ""guilt"" because I am highly against self shaming, especially in the food department. With that in mind - this tea doesn't completely replace a cheesecake. I'll still eat my fair share of cheesecake! What this tea DOES do is let you have cheesecake every day - even if your tummy is full or your wallet is empty!

25,2,25,Perfect Cheesecake Flavor,"WOW is this stuff good! The cheesecake flavor really comes through, adding a creamy decadence to the cup along with cheesecake's signature tang and even a little bit of crusty goodness. It doesn't overwhelm the matcha flavor but balances with it, making this sweet treat not overly dessert-y but great for drinking any time of day.

26,2,26,Will Work For Tea,"Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!",2012-09-04 19:00,48,0,0,5

The first time I prepared it, I prepared it the way I would most Matcha - in the traditional way in my chawan (tea bowl) and whisking it until smooth and frothy.  It is good that way.  It has a delicious, creamy taste.  Sweet.  Really good, and tasting very much like cheesecake.<br /><br />However, if you really want the FULL cheesecake experience, I recommend drinking this one as a latte, using warmed milk instead of water and whisking with a frothing tool instead of the bamboo whisk.  YUM!  The creamier texture and flavor that comes from using milk instead of water is really beneficial to this cheesecake flavored Matcha.  All the flavor remains intact - it is not masked by the milk - and it tastes creamier and richer ... and let's face it, when you want cheesecake, you want that rich, creamy flavor and texture.<br /><br />This cheesecake flavored Matcha is rich, smooth, and sweet, with the distinctive tangy taste of cream cheese and even a hint of buttery pastry.  It makes a delightful pick-me-up for the afternoon, especially if you're craving something a little sweet.

I still am amazed that Red Leaf Tea can get such excellent flavor from all natural sources into a matcha!<br /><br />This flavor melded perfectly with the green tea base giving it a beautiful slightly sweet and creamy earthy flavor! I imagine it would be insanely good in a white base as well!<br /><br />You can almost taste the crumbly cheesecake crust in this as well as the taste of the filling so you do get that whole cheesecake experience.",2012-08-30 19:00,50,0,0,5

I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink.  Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good.<br /><br />My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the ""bleh"" side.  The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet.  However, as I drank a little more it grew on me.  It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening.<br /><br />For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot.  Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though.",2011-10-17 19:00,52,12,0,3
31,3,31,Not the best brand of this producct,"This product has a nasty aftertaste because it is sweetened with aspertame, not sugar.  It is overly sweet and has little apple flavour.

32,3,32,Extremely unpleasant taste,"I was very hopeful about this product.  While I did not expect anything close to real apple cider, an occasional warm apple flavored drink at work was a welcome idea.  And while this product is sugar free (sweetened with aspartame), that didn't scare me away as I've enjoyed some other drink products sweeted with aspartame.  Well, I brought my new purchase to work this morning, and brewed my first cup.  The aroma was pleasant ... could smell the apple right away and then a few moments later could smell the caramel.  But then I tasted it - and it was awful!  I sipped it hot, sipped it warm, and even tried another cup with a different amount of water.  I'm done!  The taste is extremely chemical with little to no apple taste (nor caramel).

Obviously, it's not going to taste the same for people who are used to cane sugar and corn syrup sweeteners. Now, most importantly, the taste is RICH, SWEET and hearty. It is not weak, and it even has some of that apple ""bite"". The smell is just like mulling cider on the stove. Each serving is only 10 calories, and best of all, it isn't full of sugar for those of us juvi diabetics and gastric bypass patients out there. This feels like Cheating! It's absolutely delicious and I intend to always keep it on hand. Thank you Grove Square for remembering the sugar-restrictions!",2012-01-22 19:00,56,5,0,5
35,3,35,Nice change from coffee,"Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.  Just to check out what's inside, I cut open a new cup and small amuont of brown and white powder is all there is to this.",2011-09-20 19:00,57,5,0,3

In a coffee K-Cup, there is more to it than just coffee grounds in the K-Cup...there is a filter etc, and the brewing occurs in the cup.  With these cider K-cups, it's just ordinary drink mix in the K-Cup.

Before ordering, I noted that under ""Product Features"" it states that the product is sugar-free; and under ""Product Description"" it clearly states that the product is sweetened with aspartame.

39,3,39,Reminds me of how A&W Root Beer tasted when I was a kid,"The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors.  It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants.<br /><br />In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free.  This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats.",2010-01-06 19:00,61,25,1,5

(Read on)","First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!",2011-01-23 19:00,62,111,19,1
41,4,41,Love the Root Beer flavor,I finally found this soda at a local store. Not much on the shelf. I tried the zevia regular cola (bad aftertaste) the root beer one (this is my favorite) and the orange one (good). I didn't get the lemon/lime one. This rootbeer one is delicious. No aftertaste like the cola one has. I love rootbeer so I will continue to buy it. It is expensive at $1 a can and for the 6 pack it cost me $5.99 with no tax on it. It is a much better alternative to the diet sodas out there. I don't use artifical sweetners or have sugar in my diet except for stevia. I hope the price gets lower as other stevia colas come onto the market.,2009-03-08 19:00,63,11,0,5
42,4,42,Excellent artisan rootbeer taste!,"I am currently drinking my second can of Zevia Root Beer, having managed to sneak it away from my three kids.  It's got a rich, full flavor and plenty of fizz--all our cans did.<br /><br />I left a fuller review on their Cola entry, but everything I said there stands for this variety, as well.  It's just as good as either sugar-full or sugar-free brands, but is not bad for you, and even good for you because of the stevia, which can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />Makes a killer float, too, with my own homemade sugar-free artificial sweetener-free ice cream.",2008-07-21 19:00,64,9,1,5
43,4,43,Natural Ginger Root Beer with stevia tastes great,"When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise's site, I couldn't wait to try it.  It took many visits to specialty stores (names obtained from the Zevia website) before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock.  I bought both cans, even though I never really drink root beer.  After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer, I love root beer now!  This is my favorite flavor, even over Cola and Orange (haven't had the Twist, yet).<br /><br />Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural, and there's no caffeine (like the Cola, even though it's supposed to be natural caffeine). The cola is  my next favorite that I have occasionally.  I did not care much for the orange, it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting. I highly recommend the root beer flavor, though.",2009-04-01 19:00,65,3,0,5
44,4,44,The best Zevia flavor,"My wife and I have tried the four flavors of Zevia and we both have this as our favorite.  Using Stevia instead of sugar or the common sugar substitutes is great.  The price is OK.  It would be nice if Amazon could make a deal with Zevia to offer ""FREE with Super Saver Shipping"" in the future.  At this time the $9.89 shipping makes the price less attractive.<br /><br />When we drink ""traditional"" soft drinks we mostly drink diet drinks.  We get Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi (when available at places like restaurants) as first choices.  I tolerate Diet Coke when I want a diet soft drink at a restaurant and none of the above are available.  Although, I may also get a non-diet soft drink if that is the case.  I included some of the other drinks we like, since taste is subjective.  Hopefully if you like the above drinks, Zevia's Root Beer may be to your liking.",2009-02-19 19:00,66,3,0,5

My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and orange, however all their flavors are super!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either. Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly.

Also like the ginger ale, but think the root beer is my favorite.<br /><br />I tried the orange and didn't like that very much.<br /><br />There's a new one Dr. Zevia, that looks very good, like Dr. Pepper I guess, that has caffeine if you want caffeine, but I haven't tried that one.<br /><br />I find the Zevia very refreshing and great.  At first there was a very slight unusual taste, but I quickly got used to it and now really like it.  Especially since it is zero calories and no bad things in it, like aspartame.<br /><br />Not sure why some of the Zevia's qualify for no shipping and others have a large shipping fee.

52,4,1,Doesn't taste good.,"Unfortunately, this soda just doesn't taste good in orange flavor. It has a strange flavor, I think it might be the taste of the stevia interfering with the orangeyness.

55,5,4,The One and Only,"I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).<br />I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent crap that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening).<br />Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed.",2010-09-30 19:00,77,32,0,5
56,5,5,Best brand for Thai red curry,"This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.  Chop 1 onion into chunks, heat up 2 tbsp. of canola oil in a wok or dutch oven, toss in the onions and stir for a minute or so until translucent.  Take 1 tbsp of Mae Ploy red curry paste for a mild curry (use 3 tbsp. if you enjoy spicy foods like jalapenos) and stir into the onions, stir and heat for a minute, then pour in half a can of coconut milk, stir again, and turn heat to medium, toss in 1 lb. of cubed meat (beef or chicken or pork or duck), 2 lime leaves, a few dashes of fish sauce, stir to mix well. Turn heat down to simmer for 15 minutes, add chopped bell pepper strips, bamboo shoots and 2 handfuls of fresh basil, simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the remaining half of coconut milk, stir to mix well, then turn off heat immediately. Remove the lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice.<br /><br />The other reason we love Mae Ploy brand so much is because it's the only brand available here locally that has NO MSG, NO PRESERVATIVES.

60,6,9,Afraid to try it at first but it's THE BEST,"I've only ever used the curry pastes they sell in my local chain supermarket. It comes in a tiny jar, is $7, and has such little flavor I almost need to use an entire jar every time I make curry.<br /><br />After doing some Amazon searches for curry paste this one seemed to have the most, and best, ratings. And it has  A LOT of paste in the container! So I ordered it. I figured if Thai folks use this curry, it must be good.<br /><br />And it is! It's the best, and now my curry rivals that of the local restaurants. We don't go out for curry anymore, since it takes less than 30 minutes to make one that tastes just as good.<br /><br />The container is huge, and it will take months for me to work through it even if I make curry once per week.<br />When I first smelled the curry I was a little afraid to use it. The spices are definitely in there, and I started to sneeze from the chili! But I tried it and all the scariness of the curry went away. It smelled amazing, the amount of kick was perfect, and it was not overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and I will definitely stock up. This is cheap, free shipping with Prime, and it's the best curry paste I have ever used.",2011-07-27 19:00,82,5,0,5

An easy master recipe is right on the canister, you just decide what vegetables or meats to use, and I haven't tried any yet that did'nt taste great.

65,6,14,"UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter","Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O"">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.",2011-10-25 19:00,87,90,4,5

68,7,17,Great innovative product,"I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.  I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.  I just ordered my second bag of PB2!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8"">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>",2011-06-27 19:00,90,17,1,5
69,7,6,Wow!  Glad I ordered the pound bag,"As much as I love all things peanut, the grand goober is taboo while I'm counting calories.  Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept.",2011-12-06 19:00,91,12,0,5

I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.",2011-10-08 19:00,92,6,0,5
71,7,4,"Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter","I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.",2012-05-17 19:00,93,13,3,2
72,7,3,Did someone say AMAZING,"I sure thought having to mix powder with water sounded weird, but I thought it was worth a shot after reading the reviews (and after Walden Farms' peanut spread proved yucky, lol), but it's great! The taste and texture is just like peanut butter--I could kiss whoever came up with this, LOL.<br /><br />I don't like to waste food, so I have been mixing it with my Walden Farms' spread, which makes it that much less calorie, and it actually tastes good mixed together. Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!). I will definitely be purchasing it again.",2011-12-05 19:00,94,5,0,5

76,7,25,Very pleasantly surprised,"I bought both the regular and chocolate versions.  I was expecting it to be barely tolerable and I would use it only in baking. Boy, was I wrong.  I mixed each with water and it tasted amazing.  I added a half a pack of Equal to the 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and it was even better.<br /><br />I had given up peanut butter because it was just too many Weight Watchers points and now I can have it again.  This is just about perfect and I was a total skeptic.<br /><br />Another surprise was that it wasn't as costly as I thought.  My $8 jar of Jif has 35 servings and this $10 bag of PB2 has 37 servings. For a mere 20% increase, I'm thrilled to buy this.",2012-02-16 19:00,98,0,0,5

85,9,34,The perfect rice for making sushi,"Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive.<br /><br />To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009E3F68"">Panasonic SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker</a>, but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster.<br /><br />You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQKHUI"">Nishiki Premium Rice</a>. These are the two major brands I use and recommend. If you can't find either of these, a third brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCHN8Q"">Botan Rice</a>.",2009-11-29 19:00,107,16,2,5
86,9,35,Exceptional Rice!,I've tasted different rice varieties and this one is incomparable in taste and texture. Some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed. Also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods. Excellent for sushi. People who like their cooked rice a bit glutinuous will love this.,2007-02-22 19:00,108,15,2,5
87,9,36,Great for Sushi,"This was recommended on a Sushi making site and I can see why. The difference in the Sushi from last time to this time was tremendous, and the only difference was the rice that I used.",2007-05-13 19:00,109,9,2,5
88,9,37,Delicious Rice,"This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery, primarily because it's sticky. When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared. I find that both white and brown rice becomes hard after sitting in the fridge overnight and I end up throwing the leftovers away, but this rice is simply not the same. It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later.",2011-06-21 19:00,110,2,0,5
89,9,38,very good!,I live in Japan (for now) and this is the rice that always sells out the most at our local store and I have to buy it in 20lb bags for my house but the price on here is high. But it is worth it.,2009-09-30 19:00,111,2,0,5
90,9,39,Yummy!,This is great rice - I cook this in my rice cooker ALL the time to go with my chicken curry.  BUT.....$13 is WAY overpriced.  You can get this in most local grocery stores (like Giant and Shoppers) for less than $7 for a 5lb bag.,2008-05-31 19:00,112,6,2,5
91,9,40,Inferior to other sticky rice brands,"I tried this brand along with about 5 others while on a recent sushi making kick.  This rice was significantly inferior to several brands of other California grown sticky rice, as well actual sticky rice from Japan.  Rice came out more mushy than other brands - almost like it was overcooked, and on several occasions I would find a few hard pieces of rice mixed in with the rest.  It's passable, but definitely not preferred, especially if you are trying to make sushi or something else where rice texture is important. At the time of this review the price is $14.95 for a 5 lb bag, compared to $7.20 for the same bag at my local Japanese supermarket - the review grade does not reflect this price differential, recognizing that it could change.  I should point out however, that at $15 for a 5 lb bag, you can buy premium sticky rice imported from Japan in a decent Japanese supermarket.<br /><br />Update: Have added additional brands to my comparison list, this one really is on the bottom by far, I question whether the 5 star reviewers have tried any other options (just about any California short grain variety, Botan Calrose from the supermarket, Nishiki - all significantly better than this.)",2012-09-03 19:00,113,1,0,1
92,9,41,An astonished and ecstatic novice user,"I'm quite the novice when it comes to rice, so I'm not going to deliver any lectures on the genetic and cultural history of sticky white rice. I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now.",2012-07-01 19:00,114,1,0,5
93,9,42,Absolutely wonderful,"I bought a bag of this and a steamer from Amazon earlier this week and received both today.  I have to say, I didn't think it was possible but I have just made some of the best rice I have ever had.  It may be expensive and I may be inexperienced in the world of sushi rice prices but as of right now I say this stuff is worth every freaking penny.  It fluffed up and is sticky sticky sticky.  Awesome.",2012-02-14 19:00,115,1,0,5
94,9,43,Great rice for sushi,"Pretty clean rice, doesn't need much washing as compared to the cheap stuff I got at an asian market down the street.  Cooks up nice, tastes good.  Doesn't have any dark stuff that floats up during washing (or cooking, heave forbid!).  Wish I could buy a 50 pound bag of the stuff for a bulk discount.",2012-01-05 19:00,116,1,0,5
95,9,44,Excellent rice.,"I love Kokuho Rose rice and have been eating it since the early 80's. The only problem has been finding it in something other than 10 lb. bags. The 5 lb. bag is the perfect size and the rice itself is great eating, and you can eat this rice all by itself, no topping/flavoring necessary.",2011-08-25 19:00,117,1,0,5
96,9,45,Versatile and easy to love,"I'd never tried this rice before, despite seeing it around forever and hearing good things about it. Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine. I was surprised to find it too bland for eating, but it worked just fine for the wine.",2011-03-09 19:00,118,1,0,5

106,11,4,They're noodles...and tofu!,"I first tried these tofu noodles on a whim.  They looked interesting, low-calorie, and fun to eat.  I am so happy I found these noodles!<br /><br />The noodles come in a pouch with water, and it is plenty for two people.  I drain out the water, add some fresh water, and microwave it in a bowl for 2 minutes.  They have a cool texture (like slippery ramen), and they have a very mild flavor.  I typically eat these noodles after adding some type of sauce and veggies.  Yummy!<br /><br />A warning:  when you first open the noodles, they smell strange.  VERY strange.  Almost so strange that you may not want to eat them!  Apparently this is normal (they are made with yam flour), and the package says to just boil them for 2 minutes to remove the smell.  After 2 minutes in the microwave, the smell really does go away!<br /><br />Overall, I love these noodles.  It is a low-cal, low-carb alternative to ramen noodles, and it has a lot of protein.  They are mild enough to mix with anything, and they are really easy to make.  Try it out and enjoy!",2005-10-30 19:00,128,274,8,5
107,11,5,A different kind of noodle,"I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a ""calcium boost"" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not ""pasta"" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of ""slippery""), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal.<br /><br />One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions.",2006-08-25 19:00,129,54,0,4
108,11,6,traditional noodles,"I spent some time in Japan and the shirataki noodles are used in a bunch of dishes including Sukiyaki.  Maybe that's why the Japanese are thin.  These noodles should be parboiled to remove the preservative.  They don't melt easily so they can be cooked for a long time.  They have a hard gelatinous texture so they don't absorb flavors easily.  I think they taste better with strong sauces, smoked meats, etc.  If you are trying to lower your carbs and/or cut calories, you can have your noodles and eat it too.",2006-01-05 19:00,130,51,3,5
109,11,7,BEST FOOD FIND EVER!!!!,"Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing.  Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly.  To prepare:  drain and then rinse VERY well.  At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit.  Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough.  Pat dry and add your favorite sauce.<br /><br />These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories.  This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said.  This is a food for health-conscious consumers.  For me, this has been the find of a lifetime.  There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic.  In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?).<br /><br />I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl.  On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...]<br /><br />For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try.  Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling.  The scent will vanish.  Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery.  Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup!  The options are limitless.  This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product.",2007-02-04 19:00,131,26,0,5
110,11,8,Not as bad as the other reviews suggest,"I ordered these noodles after reading about them on Hungry Girl.  Yes, they smell when you open them.  Just pour them into a strainer & rinse under warm water.  Then boil them for 2-5 minutes.  After that, I didn't think they smelled bad at all.  They do have a different texture, but I was able to chew them.<br /><br />If you are on a diet & tend to blow it over pasta, give these a try.  You can have a whole bag for minimal calories.  I added tomato sauce & parm. cheese.  While it's not an exact replacement for spaghetti, it does the trick if I want a big bowl of pasta.",2006-01-22 19:00,132,24,0,4
111,11,9,Most disgusting mistake of my life...,"I tried these noodles after the numerous recommendations made by the website HungryGirl, but I must say that these noodles are the MOST disgusting thing I have ever eaten.  If you want to get these noodles, I highly suggest you get one pack to try before stocking up (as I did), because you will most likely be left with packs of noodles you won't want to eat.  These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench.  Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them.  You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites.  The nutritionals are great, but they are so not worth any calories you save...they taste horrible and you'd wish you'd eaten nothing than waste 40 calories on these noodles!",2006-01-06 19:00,133,65,10,1

I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.<br /><br />Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma.<br /><br />Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew.<br /><br />Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls.",2005-12-09 19:00,134,148,28,1

Also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes.  If the texture doesn't bother you, then go ahead and try it with your favorite western-style dishes.<br /><br />Shirataki (shredded konjac) really has no flavor itself, but like tofu, it absorbs flavors extremely well.

I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious.",2006-09-04 19:00,136,15,0,4
115,11,13,"Don't expect Italian pasta texture, but enjoy a new one.","It ain't spaghetti, folks, but used properly it can enhance your eating. It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten ""as is"" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.<br /><br />For the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! I'm in the same boat, and we can still enjoy pasta, we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. I weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently), and I use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.The oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. Of course, if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch, don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. And I have given up the (white) Italian bread on the side! That's the worst part, but the pasta is at least do-able.",2006-07-26 19:00,137,14,0,4
116,11,14,Awesome.,"My partner has to moniter blood sugar so we really don't get to eat a lot of pasta, bread, or starches like potato.  We found these at a local store and gave them a try.  They require attention to prepare: you have to drain, rinse, and parboil the noodles to remove the smell of the preservative, but once that is done these noodles are great.  I make them in thai noodle dishes and with some italian pasta sauces.  They are better with the thai dishes because they cook with the sauce a little more.<br /><br />Worth the effort especially if you have a limited diet because of sugar restrictions.",2006-01-26 19:00,138,14,0,5
117,11,15,Hypoglycemic dream food. . .,"After reading some of the negative reviews for this product, I had to contribute my experience.  I am a hypoglycemic, which means that I have to severely restrict my consumption of breads, sugars, and carbohydrates including pastas and starches.  This week I was able to enjoy noodles again.  This product is fantastic.  I tried it in a Pad Thai dish and it perfectly resembled real noodles, in texture as well as flavor.  I have not tried it plain with a pasta sauce, for example, so I cannot vouch for how it tastes on its own.  It is VERY IMPORTANT, however, that when you prepare Shirataki you have to first strain the liquid from the bag out, soak in fresh water, then boil for two minutes.  After that you can add it to any dish you like! This eliminates any of the ""chewy-ness"" or gummi-ness that some other customers were complaining about.  All in all, the process does not take any longer than you would normally experience in boiling some raw pasta noodles...and if you ask me, it is well worth it.  Just to be able to enjoy eating noodles again without throwing my blood sugar off is a miracle!",2006-01-26 19:00,139,13,0,5
118,11,16,I love these noodles!,"I have been eating this product for the past 2 years.  I picked them up one day at the supermarket because they looked interesting.  To my surprise, they were great.  I love this product.  The noodles are filling and are certainly NOT as bad as some of these reviews suggest.  I think that eating healthy is always a challenge.  This food does not taste gross.  Actually, there is not too much taste to it at all until you put a sauce on it (just like most Tofu products).  The texture is a little softer than most noodles but certainly far from GROSS.  We need to do what we need to do for health's sake!  Give em a try; I think you will be pleasantly surprised!!",2006-01-23 19:00,140,13,0,5
119,11,17,great pleaser,"Having begged a local super market WEGMANS in Buffalo NY suburbs,I found this product in the refrigerated isle w/yogurt and procesed and packaged ready to eat heat and serve items.<br /><br /> Texture was not exactley what I expected,but knowing that being a type II diabetic put regular spagetti out of reach (too high in carbs.)I ate the treat with my favorite sauce,then proceeded to put on my shoes and drive directley to the supermarket to purchase another pound of SHIRATAKI Spagetti for my next planned sauce meal.<br /><br /> This product is great for me because I eat alone several times a week , it is easy to prepare and is satisfying .<br /><br /> I do have a problem with the high cost $1.99 per pound,but I will use this product again just not as often as I would like.",2006-07-24 19:00,141,19,2,4

I was lucky enough to read this on HG's website.  You have to rinse it REALLY, REALLY well in strainer.  Then pat it dry.  Completely dry.  Then i add whatever sauce and microwave for less than a minute.  Ive had it 2 days in a row and im ordering more now!  My first order came within one day! Go noodles!",2006-03-25 19:00,142,15,1,4
121,11,19,"Fast, Tasty, but Not Cheap","As a Manhattanite, a vegetarian, and someone who takes food VERY seriously and is always on the lookout for quick, tasty, healthful meals, Asian cuisine of all stripes comprises a substantial percentage of my diet. I happened upon Amazon reviews of this product quite by accident, so sought it out when I was near a Gristedes, where I was directed to the produce section. Having read the reviews as well as being familiar with various Asian pastas, e.g., rice noodles, mung bean noodles, egg noodles, etc., I was neither put off nor surprised by descriptions of this product's texture/smell. I bought one each of this (which, surprisingly, I preferred) and the ramen-type and have tried both with Annie Chun's Thai Peanut Sauce (and now wish I'd had some chopped peanuts to add for texture).<br />Actually, the oft-cited aroma didn't hit me until the 2.5 minute parboiling recommended on the package and yes, it was rather peculiar. But it disappeared quickly and the noodles had no aroma or particular flavor afterward. I suggest draining them very well and blotting them with a paper towel so that they're more receptive to absorbing the sauce of your choice. I don't think they're a good choice as a vehicle for Western-type sauces--their texture is very Asian and is complemented by Asian sauces. But hey, that's just me; other people who've reviewed them enjoy them with Western dressings. They pick up the flavor of sauces quite well, have a negligible calorie count (40 for the whole package), are low in carbs, and actually contain a bit of protein. I have no reason to think they wouldn't work equally well in stir-fries and soups. My only complaint is that at two bucks a pop for an appetizer-sized portion, they're expensive--discovering that the nutritional analysis was based on a two-serving package earned a derisive snort from yours truly. I checked Koreatown (same price) and found them in Chinatown for $1.45--still not cheap, but definitely easier to justify at 25+% cheaper than two bucks.<br />Not for everyone, but really yummy for those who like Asian food or are receptive to trying something new. I think these are directed more towards the Japanese and Korean communities, but I gave them enough of a rave that the Chinese vendors who sold them to me seem inclined to give them a try themselves.",2007-01-11 19:00,143,11,0,4
122,11,20,The Shirataki Experiment,"I've seen these around but all the negative press told me it wasn't worth the agony of trying to choke these stinky slimy suckers down. Anyway, practicing the reasonable-carb lifestyle, I rarely eat pasta but miss the convenience of pasta dishes for lunch.  Wondering if they were really *that* bad, I busted out the fiver I had burning a hole in my pocket and bought two bags. Ready for the most horrendous smell that had ever invaded human nostrils, I opened the bag and held my breath.  No sirens went off, the cats were still walking around and life appeared to go on, so I let my guard down and decided to take a breath while the noodles and I were in the same room.  Silly me, I thought to myself.  I've been fooled by the drama of Amazon reviewers.  Sure they do have a smell, but steaming up some brussels sprout will leave you worse off. A 30-second generous rinse of hot water in my favorite yellow Tupperware strainer yielded a healthy portion of stench-free noodles.  Then I decided to do what no man has dared to do before! I reach into the strainer with my index finger and opposable thumb, pinched a tablespoon-sized serving of plain hot rinsed noodles, and stuck them directly in my mouth! O.M.G.... nothing happened.  So I made my spaghetti and had a great day.",2010-05-10 19:00,144,10,0,5
123,11,21,"Finally, a GREAT substitute for noodles and pasta! And here's the calorie info...","I agree with the reviewer who gave these a stellar rating. We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search.<br /><br />These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were ""tough"" and ""inedible"". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well.<br /><br /> As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an ""al dente"" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the ""al dente"" side. If you don't like ""chewy"" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit.<br /><br />True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion.<br /><br /> The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta.<br /><br />  We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta.<br /><br />  This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others).<br /><br />PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the ""noodles"". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet. I did heat the noodles in the microwave after draining them because they do tend to leak liquid even when they are heated up without any. I added the other ingredients to the hot noodles and heated gently on the stovetop. Leftovers were eaten cold.",2006-03-10 19:00,145,13,1,5
124,11,22,Good Product,"I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in.<br /><br />The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well.<br /><br />I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta.",2006-04-15 19:00,146,9,0,4

I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own.",2006-06-06 19:00,147,20,4,1
126,11,24,Pretty Good,The noodles need to be rinsed before cooking.  This is very important unless you like fishy smelling food!  I like these better than the thin noodles.  These seem to have a better texture.  They go great with some stir fried veggies and a little toasted seseme oil.<br /><br />You can get these for about $2 at Trader Joes.  The shipping for these is very high and not really worth it for such a tiny bag of pasta.,2007-03-09 19:00,148,6,0,4
127,11,25,Surprisingly Good,"I was always scared away from trying these things from all the bad reviews complaining about the smell and texture. However, a local grocer recently started stocking them so I couldn't resist paying the few dollars for a package.<br /><br />I was shocked - no smell but I boiled them up to warm them up anyways. They went great with a simple tomato sauce and grated cheese. You get a good size bowl of mild flavored noodles that may be slighty more slippery than regular pasta, but nothing that bother my tastes. For 40 calories its a good thing to add to dishes when you need to eat light - soups would be really ideal with this type of noodle.",2007-05-18 19:00,149,5,0,5

Others have said they like them, I suggest you try one package to make your decision. I think this is a food that requires a less sensitive taste mechanism to eat.",2006-01-28 19:00,150,7,1,1
129,11,27,"Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled","I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as ""chewy"" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a ""diet"" never tasted so good, baby!<br /><br />We haven't heard the last of shirataki!",2006-03-13 19:00,151,9,2,5
130,11,28,Very good pasta,"Not quite the texture of pasta, but was still very good.  Since pasta does not have a flavor anyway, it just took on the flavor of the sauce and tasted the same.  I would recommend to anyone who does not want the heaviness of pasta.",2006-03-22 19:00,152,4,0,4
131,11,29,Tofu Shirataki Noodles....THUMBS UP!,"After reading many of the reviews for the Tofu Shirataki noodles, I was skeptical of trying them. But, I was able to find them at the local Shoppers Market and decided to try a bag. I expected the cost to be high, but was pleasantly surprised that they were only a dollar a bag on sale! I bought a bag of the spaghetti shaped noodles since they were out of the fettucini. I then bought a jar of low fat Ragu Alfredo Sauce. This sauce has a lot lower carbs than the tomato based sauces so that is why I decided to use it.<br /><br />As far as the preparation, I put a pot of water on the stove and began to boil it. When I opened the bag of Tofu Shirataki noodles, I expected a strong ""fishy"" smell. Believe me, the smell is very slight and not at all anything to be grossed out about. I then rinsed the noodles in a colander with hot water for a few minutes. I then put the noodles in the pot of boiling water and boiled them for about 2 to 3 minutes. When I drained them in the colander, there was NO SMELL at all. To be honest, there wasn't a smell after I just rinsed them thoroughly, but I boiled them anyway. After rinsing again in hot water I then used paper towel and DRIED THE NOODLES very thoroughly. The noodles are a little long, so I cut them with a pair of kitchen scissors.<br /><br />I prepared a serving of Ragu Alfredo sauce and then poured it over the noodles. At this point, nothing was different than if I used regular spaghetti. The Tofu Shirataki absorbed the alfredo sauce very nicely and it looked rather appetizing. Now for the taste test. When I put the noodles in my mouth, they were no different than regular spaghetti. It is when I bit down on the noodle that I noticed the difference. The texture is firmer and a little bit chewy, but not like a ""rubber band"" like some of the reviews stated. That was the biggest difference in these noodles. However, it just took a little bit of time to get used to the texture. After a few mouthfuls it didn't bother me at all, and I was surprised how great it tasted and how well the sauce was absorbed by the noodle.<br /><br />The bottom line is....I LOVE the Tofu Shirataki noodles and will definitely buy them again! Now, I am glad that I bought the spaghetti shape noodles because I think that the fettucini noodles would be much more ""chewy"" because of the size of the noodles. So for now, I will stick with the spaghetti version. Gice them a try and ENJOY!",2011-05-01 19:00,153,4,0,4

Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these ""Atkins friendly"" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well-seasoned snacks).

164,16,11,Shake 'N' Bake - Aunt Agatha explains,"You all know Amazon for its forward-looking attitude, and this is also obvious in the review pages. That's why, in this review of Shake and Bake Original Pork, I will be calling on my Aunt Agatha to do a special review for all of you.<br /><br />By Interpretive Dance.<br /><br />Agatha is getting on now, but in her day she hoped to be a prima ballerina (even though she only made it to centesimo ballerina). She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu-tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!<br /><br />Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, ""The Ballet Class,"" but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.<br /><br />And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair, breathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.<br /><br />No doubt, when she gets her breath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest. And you can feel proud of yourself that you were in at the beginning of a new kind of product review, thanks to Amazon.",2011-07-26 19:00,186,1,2,4
165,16,12,Lacks flavor,"This product did not include the ""shaking bag"". In addition, the package says that it will cover 6 pork chops. I was only able to coat 4 thin chops. The chops were done in 15 minutes as promised BUT they were not flavorful at all. Dry coating without much seasoning. I recall having shake n bake in youth and it was much more tasty. I so wanted to love this nostalgic food, but it just was not good at all. ):",2011-07-25 19:00,187,1,3,1
166,16,13,I don't HATE it,"Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about ""the photograph I've thoughtfully added.""  Maybe later.<br /><br />-- Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted.",2011-07-28 19:00,188,2,4,2
167,16,14,"Light flavor, light breading, nice taste","I don't fix much pork (I don't know why?!), but I picked up some (4) thin cut pork tenderloins to use with this product.  I had plenty of Shake'N Bake crumbs left over to do more chops/tenderloins.  I liked how the crumbs gave the pork a light taste and certainly did NOT overpower the meat itself.  I don't like tons of flavorings to overpower what I'm eating, so if that is what you typically want/need (like tons of salt, garlic, etc.), I'm not sure if this will do it for you.  You could probably add some garlic or spices to the crumb mix if you needed to.  I'm currently on a low-carb diet, so I was not going to put my pork in the mix, but, looking at the label, it really wasn't too bad - so I had some myself!  And, even if you don't want to eat the breading, but you do want the flavor, it was easy to scrape off of the port after cooking.

Pair this off with a simple sidedish, string beans maybe, and you have a perfectly satisfying and easy-to-fix weeknight dinner.  It also doesn't hurt that both calorie and carb counts for this product are minimal!<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed my free sample of Shake 'N Bake Original Pork coating, and will certainly pick up more at my own expense in the near future.",2011-08-02 19:00,190,5,1,4

There was not much flavor nor texture added to the pork chops.<br /><br />It was certainly easy, but it doesn't take much to fix up your own breading so saving an extra couple of minutes is not worth the lack of flavor in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product and will likely stay away from other Shake 'N Bake products.",2011-11-28 19:00,193,1,0,2

Later the same day, was surprised to receive an email that they had additinally credited my account $10 for delay in receiving (based on original order date, not replacement date). Very impressed.

175,17,22,Somewhat disapointed,"Despite of my initial disappointment with the distilled vinegar that arrived and the items received not being the same as the ones pictured in the Amazon.com profile I decided to raise number of stars from 2 to 3. 3 stars are for the misleading photos in the product profile and the different items in the package that I received (please read the details below). The mother culture itself is wonderful and produced beautiful, absolutely great tasting kombucha in one week and a gorgeous scoby.<br /><br />The package arrived in a reasonable time. However, the starter liquid came in a PLASTIC bottle and only enough to start one quart of kombucha. The description ( of the product on Amazon.com)regarding the contents of the package was not specific enough. The photograph shows a plastic bag with Scoby and liquid, a mysterious brown bag/envelope and what it looks like instructions sheet. Another photograph shows a jar labeled : Kombucha Starter. NONE of these items were included in the package I received. I received a small ziploc bag with Scoby, instructions sheet and a small plastic bottle labeled: ""Starter Liquid"". When I opened the bottle  I realized it is nothing but distilled vinegar. After studying the ways of how to start kombucha tea process I learned that the starter should be the already fermented kombucha tea. According to the seller: Lifetime Kefir company instructions, white distilled vinegar can also be used. Then why isn't the tiny PLASTIC bottle containing WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR labeled as such? Why use such deception? Starter liquid should be the fermented kombucha tea. I do not think it is so expensive that it cannot be included instead of WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR. The only reason I am not going to return this package is that it is not worth my time.",2012-06-27 19:00,197,2,0,3

This 22 oz. size lasts for a long time and is worth the price.",2012-09-26 19:00,217,0,0,5
196,21,4,Heaven in a jar!,"Move over Nutella...this is my new favorite guilty pleasure!  It doesn't have a strong almond flavor, nor does it have a strong caramel flavor. The perfect balance of the two make the most sensation thing I've tasted in a long time.  It sort of reminds me of a smooth butterscotch flavor. To.Die.For!",2012-04-05 19:00,218,3,0,5
197,21,3,Mara Natha Caramel Spread,"Amazing...I am not usually an almond person unless they are smoked an toasted. Well that has all changed now that I have tasted this almond spread.<br />the creamy rich taste of almonds along with the caramel flavor of the spread makes it so hard to not just sit down with a spoon and have at it.<br />i now have to find places that sell it at a reasonable price on line. I live just far enough away from stores to make this a cost effective method of buying this spread.<br />i hope this isn't another product that I really like and then they quit making it. my recomendation is to get it now and try it..it is amazing, who knew that something so good for you could taste this good as well.",2012-10-22 19:00,219,0,0,5

199,21,1,Disgusting,"I'm so disappointed in this almond spread. I thought when I bought it, it would be caramel flavored almond butter, but it's really not. It's mostly sugar and it tastes so fake and gross. It tastes like preservatives. It's cheap ""natural caramel flavor"" spread. It leaves a terrible aftertaste in your mouth. I took one serving and threw the entire jar away... there's no way I'm going to even finish it. Gross.",2012-04-09 19:00,221,1,4,1
